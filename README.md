## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>This explains the main app and how it solves the problem</h3>
  <ul><li>Our proposed solution is a comprehensive, multilingual, and AI-powered agricultural advisory platform designed specifically for small and marginal farmers in India. The core of our solution is a mobile application and chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific guidance on crop selection, soil health management, and fertilizer usage. The system leverages artificial intelligence to analyze local conditions and deliver personalized recommendations that help farmers optimize yields while reducing input costs. To address the challenge of pest and disease management, we have integrated an image recognition system that allows farmers to upload photos of affected crops for instant diagnosis and treatment advice</li>
<li>It directly tackles the core issues faced by farmers:

· Replaces Guesswork: The AI-powered app provides scientific, data-driven advice on crops, soil, and fertilizers, moving farmers away from unreliable traditional knowledge.
· Solves Language & Literacy Barriers: The app's multilingual voice support and the option to use a simple phone call make it accessible to everyone.
· Reduces Costs: Precise fertilizer and pesticide recommendations prevent overuse, saving input costs.
· Improves Yield & Income: Accurate advisories on farming practices, combined with market price data, directly contribute to better productivity and profitability.
· Bridges the Digital Divide: The toll-free number is the key innovation that ensures the solution is inclusive, reaching the most marginalized farmers who are often left out of digital revolutions.</li>
<li>Our solution is unique due to itshybrid, inclusive model. While many agri-tech solutions are purely digital, "KrishiMitra" recognizes the ground reality of India's diverse farming community. The integration of a toll-free number that facilitates direct field visits from agricultural officers is a critical innovation. This human-in-the-loop approach combines the scalability of AI with the trust and effectiveness of personal, on-site interaction. This ensures 100% coverage of the target audience, making it truly a solution for all farmers, not just the digitally equipped.</li></ul>

## Technical Approach
<h3>Technically it can be used by using mobile phone as well as toll free:</h3>
<ul><li>· Mobile App Development: React Native (for cross-platform compatibility on Android and iOS)
· Backend & API: Python with Django REST framework
· AI/ML Models: TensorFlow and PyTorch for building image recognition (pest/disease detection) and predictive analytics (crop advisory) models.
· Database: PostgreSQL (for reliable and structured data storage)
· Cloud Telephony: Twilio or similar API to implement the toll-free number and call routing system.
· Cloud Services: AWS or Google Cloud for scalable storage and computing power.
· Geolocation & Maps: Google Maps API for location-specific services.
· Weather Data: Integration with IMD (India Meteorological Department) or OpenWeatherMap API</li>
<li>1. Requirement Analysis: Detailed workshops with farmers and NGO partners to finalize features.
2. System Design: Create architecture diagrams and flowcharts for both the app and the call center workflow.
3. Prototyping: Develop a working prototype (a minimal viable product) with core features like user registration, crop advisory, and the toll-free number landing page.
4. Development:
   · Build the backend APIs for data handling.
   · Develop the front-end mobile application.
   · Train the initial AI models for pest detection.
   · Set up the cloud telephony system and CRM for call center officers.</li></ul>

## Feasibility and Viability
<h3>It shows the analysis,challenges,risks and strategies</h3>
<ul><li>The idea is highly feasible.The proposed technologies are mature, widely available, and have strong developer communities. The increasing penetration of smartphones and mobile networks in rural India makes the digital component viable. The physical component (toll-free & visits) leverages existing agricultural extension models but makes them more efficient through technology.</li>
<li>· Low Digital Literacy: Could hinder app adoption.
· Connectivity Issues: Poor internet in remote villages could affect app functionality.
· Data Accuracy: The AI models require large, localized datasets to be accurate.
· Scalability of Field Visits: Managing a large number of physical visit requests could be logistically challenging and costly.</li>
<li>· For Literacy & Connectivity: The toll-free number is our primary strategy to overcome this.
· For Data Accuracy: Partner with agricultural universities and government bodies (like KVKs) to access authentic, localized data for training our AI models.
· For Scalability: Implement a tiered support system. Simple queries are resolved via call; only complex issues trigger a field visit. Partner with local NGOs and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) to create a distributed network of officers.</li></ul>

## Impact and Benefits
<h3>How it Improves by socially,economically</h3>
<ul><li>This solution will empower millions of small and marginal farmers with knowledge.It will directly impact their decision-making, leading to:

· Reduced anxiety and increased confidence in farming practices.
· Tangible improvements in yield and income.
· Greater resilience to climate shocks and pest attacks.
· A sense of inclusion as they gain access to modern resources.</li>
<li>· Economic: Increased productivity and reduced input costs will raise farm incomes.
· Social: Empowerment of farmers, bridging of the digital divide, and inclusion of women and low-literacy farmers.
· Environmental: Precise application of water, fertilizers, and pesticides will promote sustainable farming and reduce environmental degradation.
· Knowledge: Creates a centralized digital repository of localized farming knowledge that can be used for future research and policy-making.</li></ul>
